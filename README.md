# IEEE_VR-AR_MRINAL
Created a software with the help of Unity and Vuforia assets to be able to print a 3D Model of Gandhiji on a Rs.500 note.

I used the Unity 2019.4.17f1 software and downloaded the Vuforia SDK online for the project.
Also, ceated and downloaded a database loaded from Vuforia with the image target being the Rs.500 note (downloaded from the internet). Also, making a new license key from Vuforia's site for the project.
